# FOR KIDS #

These are small tools or articles for my kids. I would be very happy if they are also helpful for your kids. ;)

## KidsMath ##

This is a simple html file which provide random math questions for Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division.

- This is for my first grade daughters, it is very simple, not for senior grade kids.
- It relief me from the work of generating math questions (which is a huge work for me).
- I think it is still good to help kids with their errors, so it doesn't provide answers.
